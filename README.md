# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data
# Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis algorithms, and visualization tools, we can gain valuable insights into how people perceive and interact with various topics or brands on social media platforms.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
7. Matplotlib
8. Seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualization)

# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis
# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain the social media dataset and place it in the same directory as the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Open the notebook/script and modify it to load your dataset.
4. Preprocess the text data by removing noise, tokenizing, and performing any necessary text cleaning steps such as removing stopwords or punctuation.
5. Perform sentiment analysis using either NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob, or VADER to assign sentiment scores to each social media post/comment.
6. Visualize sentiment patterns over time or across different user segments using plots such as line charts, bar charts, or heatmaps.
7. Interpret the results and analyze sentiment trends, identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards the topic or brand.
